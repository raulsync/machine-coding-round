# Traffic Light Component

## Description

This project involves creating a simple traffic light component using React. The traffic light will consist of three lights: red, yellow, and green. These lights will switch from green to yellow to red after predetermined intervals and loop indefinitely. Each light will be lit for the following durations:

- Red light: 4000ms
- Yellow light: 500ms
- Green light: 3000ms

The goal is to implement a React component that represents the traffic light and switches between these colors based on the specified intervals. Additionally, the traffic light should be styled to make it visually appealing.
